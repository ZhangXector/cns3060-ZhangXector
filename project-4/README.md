Project 4 - Disk Scheduling
===========================

I decided to use Python for this project because I had the priveledge to take the Python class from Professor Allison over the summer, and I wanted to use my skills in python to avoid forgetting what I had learned. I feel like I have already forgotten some important principles, and ended up having to look up some things that should have been second nature. I was glad for the opportunity to practice with it again.

Before this project I was unaware of how hard-drives operated. It did not even dawn on me that hard-drives need to be able to store and receive data so quickly that they required a method of handling multiple requests. Now I feel like I better understand how they work, and why some methods are chosen over others.

###First Come First Serve###
The First come first serve algorithm was definitely the easiest to implement from this project. It was straightforward in execution, simply taking the input from the user and processing it in that exact order.

###Shortest Seek Time First###
