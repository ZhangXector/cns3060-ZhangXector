Project 3 - du
==============

Cliff Kelley
------------

I found that this project was quite a bit harder than the previous projects. I started last week and was able to get the directories to list, then the sub-directories. After I figured out how to list off the files as well as the directories, I found that the sizes weren't matching up with what du -ab would report. It took a while to re-work the project to add up the sizes of the files and the sub-directories to make sure that the sizes were reporting correctly. Definite brain-buster this one was.
