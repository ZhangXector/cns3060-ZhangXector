This assignment was easily the hardest one I've done yet. Getting the basic functionality with the examples from the book wasn't that bad. Then came the attribute changing which got a little more difficult. Then there was the screen manipulation to remove the "more?" text (and later the percentage) from the screen on continuing prints. The hardest part was the last part which I spent hours on and ultimately failed at. I was unable to figure out how to get piped in input to display with canonical off. Trying to get the attributes from stdin when the input was a pipe from something like cat would only result in errors. Running this program with a filename works beautifully, and better than I expected actually. But piped input without a filename was a no-go for me. I could not find any information about it anywhere. Hoping to get some more info on it sometime, but this is the best I could do for this assignment.
