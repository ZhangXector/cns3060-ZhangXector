Project 2 - cat
===============

This project was very challenging. I made it a priority to use Vim for all the programming and GDB for all debugging. I could have used XCode, but I decided that it would be useful for me to learn to use multiple tools. I feel like I have a good beginning grasp of vim and gdb and how to use them (thank youtube for a little help on that). Coding the project itself wasn't that difficult, but the learning curve for Vim and GDB are atrocious.
